Automatic differentiation computes derivative values of computer implemented functions with accuracy up to machine precision.
The main principle behind automatic differentiation is that every function can be represented as a finite sequence of elemental unary or binary operations or static single assignment (SSA) with known derivatives e.g. unary operations as trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic operations or binary operations as addition, multiplication, division and the power operation. The derivative of the whole computation can then be computed through the chain rule.
